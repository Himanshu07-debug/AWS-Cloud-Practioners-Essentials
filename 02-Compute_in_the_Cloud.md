### `AWS Practice Essentials - Amazon EC2 Overview`

#### What is Amazon EC2?
- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: A service that provides virtual servers (instances) to host applications, offering raw compute capacity for various business needs.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Client/Server Model**: 
   - Similar to a coffee shop example, where a client requests a service, the server processes it, and then responds.
   - Applicable to various industries like healthcare, manufacturing, insurance, and video content delivery.

2. **Virtual Servers with EC2**:
   - **Cost-Effective & Flexible**: Compared to owning physical servers, EC2 is more cost-efficient, quick to start, and scalable.
   - **AWS Managed**: AWS handles the data centers, hardware, security, and ensures servers are ready for use.

3. **Traditional vs. EC2 Setup**:
   - **Traditional**:
     - Requires purchasing hardware upfront, waiting for servers to delievered to you, setting up, securing, and maintaining physical servers.
     - Time-consuming and expensive, with a fixed investment.
   - **EC2**:
     - No upfront costs; pay only for the compute resources used.
     - Instances can be started and stopped as needed.

4. **Multitenancy & Virtualization**:
   - **Virtualization**: EC2 instances share physical host machines managed by AWS using a hypervisor.
   - **Multitenancy**: Multiple virtual machines (VMs) share the same physical resources but are isolated and secure.
   - **Hypervisor**: Manages resource allocation and ensures isolation between different VMs.

5. **EC2 Flexibility**:
   - **Instance Configuration**: Choose the operating system (Windows or Linux), software, and resources (CPU, memory).
   - **Resizable Instances**: Scale up (vertically) by adding more resources as needed.
   - **Networking Control**: Decide on the network settings, including public or private access.

6. **Benefits of EC2**:
   - **Rapid Provisioning**: Quickly spin up or terminate instances.
   - **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for running instances.
   - **Enhanced Innovation**: Simplifies server acquisition, enabling faster development and deployment.

7. **Virtual Machines & EC2**:
   - Virtual machines are not new, but EC2's ease of use and cost-effectiveness make them more accessible for businesses and developers.

#### Conclusion:
- Amazon EC2 provides a robust, flexible, and cost-effective way to manage computing resources, allowing businesses to focus on innovation without worrying about underlying infrastructure.

#### `Scalability in AWS`

AWS offers significant advantages in scalability and elasticity, enabling businesses to adjust capacity based on demand, which is a major improvement over traditional on-premises data centers.

### The On-Premises Data Center Dilemma
1. **Varying Workloads:** Customer demand often fluctuates, whether over a 24-hour period or across different seasons.
2. **Hardware Investment Challenge**
3. **Average Load:** Purchasing for average usage minimizes wasted resources but can lead to shortages during peak demand.
4. **Peak Load:** Buying for the maximum load ensures customer satisfaction during peak times but results in underutilized resources most of the year.
5. **Utilization Issues:** Many data centers experience low average utilization, sometimes under 10%, due to the fear of missing peak demand.

### AWS Solution
1. **Provisioning to Demand:** AWS allows businesses to adjust capacity dynamically, matching resource allocation to current demand:
2. **Happy Customers:** Services are consistently available, even during peak times.
3. **Cost Efficiency:** Businesses only pay for the resources they use, maximizing ROI.

### Predictive scaling :
- Predictive Scaling automatically schedules the right number of Amazon EC2 instances based on predicted demand.
This is also called as `Disaster Planning.`

1. **Redundancy:** AWS supports creating redundant instances to prevent service disruption, ensuring high availability.
2. **No Single Point of Failure**

- **NOTE :** you can configure the minimum/ maximum capacity during setup


## Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- **Function**: Automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple resources (e.g., Amazon EC2 instances).
- **Load Balancer**: Acts as a single point of contact for incoming web traffic.
- **Integration**: Works with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to ensure high performance and availability.
- **Example**:
  - **Low-Demand Period**: Few EC2 instances are running, matching the demand.
  - **High-Demand Period**: More EC2 instances are launched as demand increases, and traffic is evenly distributed.

## Messaging and Queuing

## Example: Coffee Shop Ordering System
- **Tightly Coupled System**:
  - **Process**: Cashier takes the order, passes it to the barista, who prepares the drink.
  - **Issue**: If the barista is unavailable, the process halts, causing delays.
- **Loosely Coupled System with SQS**:
  - **Process**: Cashier places the order in a queue (order board) (SQS) [ Concept of messaging and Queueing ]
  - **Benefit**: Cashier can continue taking orders while the barista retrieves and prepares them from the queue.
- **Loosely Coupled System with SNS**:
  - Can send the notification to all the subscribers that there coffee is ready, in one go.

- **Tightly Coupled**: Direct communication between components (e.g., cashier and barista).
  - **Issue**: If one component fails, the entire system is affected.
- **Loosely Coupled**: Introduces a buffer or queue (e.g., order board) between components.
  - **Benefit**: If one component fails, others continue to operate without disruption.
  - **AWS Services**:
    - **Amazon SQS - Simple Queue Service**: Sends, stores, and receives messages between software components.
      - **Queue**: Holds messages until they are processed.
      - **Scalability**: Automatically scales, reliable, and easy to use.
    - **Amazon SNS - Simple Notification Service**: Publish/subscribe service for sending notifications to multiple subscribers.
      - **SNS Topic**: Channel for message delivery.
      - **Subscribers**: Can be endpoints like SQS queues, Lambda functions, or HTTP/S webhooks.
      - **Notification Delivery**: Supports mobile push, SMS, and email.



## Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture
- **Monolithic Applications**:
  - **Definition**: Tightly coupled components (e.g., databases, servers, UI, business logic).
  - **Issue**: If one component fails, others may fail, leading to a potential complete application failure.
- **Microservices**:
  - **Definition**: Loosely coupled components that operate independently.
  - **Benefit**: A single component failure does not affect the entire application.
  - **AWS Services**:
    - **Amazon SNS**: Sends messages to subscribers (e.g., web servers, email, Lambda functions).
    - **Amazon SQS**: Manages message queues for decoupled application components.
